                            Artificial Intelligence is the most debated technology of the 21st century. It is widely
                            used to solve complex problems and ease human tasks. In this video, you will learn AI in 10
                            minutes. You will understand a brief history of AI and look into what Artificial
                            Intelligence is. Then you will see the types of AI and learn the different applications of
                            AI. Finally, we'll see what the future of AI holds.

                            So how do you get started with machine learning and AI? What should you learn first? Well in
                            this video we will be discussing the exact things you need to learn to get started with
                            machine learning. We will be talking about which language to learn, how much math you need
                            and what ML algorithms to learn first.

                            Artificial Intelligence is the most debated technology of the 21st century. It is widely
                            used to solve complex problems and ease human tasks. In this video, you will learn AI in 10
                            minutes. You will understand a brief history of AI and look into what Artificial
                            Intelligence is. Then you will see the types of AI and learn the different applications of
                            AI. Finally, we'll see what the future of AI holds.
